# addresses-importer

The goal of this project is to aggregate multiple sources of addresses and then merge them into one. Currently we're using [OpenAddresses](https://openaddresses.io/) and [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).

The big part of this project being the deduplication process and cleaning the data.
